Collections of Mods and Configs for Minetest Civ Server


This project is to create a simulation in Minetest that allows players to on their own fruition form nation/city/etc type societal groups/factions and encourages them to do so. The mods included altered or unaltered are openly available, and as far as we know we have the indirect permissions of modmakers for analog mods we've used from the Minetest forums for the purposes of improving this server. Their credits as well as credits for our coders will be listed below. If you have made a mod included in this Minetest game/modpack and wish to have it removed (I don't know why this would happen) please contact us at contact@civtest.net.
